          <h2>What happened to Instagram? </h2>
          <p class="description"> Instagram claimed to be the app to replace Facebook and stood for casual photo dumps. In 2020, Instagram launched reels, a worse version of TikTok, after which it was clear that they had to stoop as low as cloning other apps to stay relevant. Multiple users have also complained about the number of ads and sponsored posts that appear on their feeds. By making such controversial updates, Instagram has lost its originality and many of its users. While I certainly agree with these users, I believe Instagram is here to stay even though most reports indicate otherwise.
Could Instagram be facing the "Innovator's Dilemma"? Here is my take on how I think Instagram will move forward and face adversity. Take a look at <a href="https://medium.com/@prahaara08/whats-happening-to-instagram-3e0725176169" target="_blank">my blog</a> for more information.</p>
